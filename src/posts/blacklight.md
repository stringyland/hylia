[Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) is a real-time web privacy inspector. It scans the site at any web address you enter, and lets you know if there are any advertising trackers, cookies or tools that Facebook and Google use to gather information about you. It's run by The Markup, a non-profit newsroom focused on technology stories. 

I checked this site and it didn't find anything, which is a relief since it's a static site generated from a template and I haven't added any trackers myself! But it showed a bunch of stuff on a news website I visit a few times a week.

You could check a few sites you spend a lot of time on. If you don't like the results, The Markup has a post for you with suggestions for what you can do to reduce how much tracking scripts follow you around the web: [I scanned the websites I visit with Blacklight and it's horrifying.
