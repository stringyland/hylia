A new resource called the Media Manipulation Handbook has been released to help researchers and journalists understand some of the challenges facing us as misinformation and propaganda speed through the internet. 

I particularly like the article [How Civil Society Can Combat Misinformation And Hate Speech Without Making It Worse](https://mediamanipulation.org/tip-sheets/how-civil-society-can-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech-without-making-it-worse). They have some useful advice for the average person who sees misinformation in their social media feeds and wants to push back on it. 

They suggest: 

1. Remember that you are part of a community - other people are not your captive audience
2. Use a Truth Sandwich - summarise the truth, briefly mention the myth or lie, then repeat the truth with more detail. 
3. Prebunk misinformation which you can predict - write a post with links to reputable sources on topics you know are wedge issues.
4. Use distributed debunking - get people you know to respond to misinformation with links to the same reputable source, a truth sandwich or humour over rumour.
5. Localise the context - most people are interested in what's happening near them. Disinformation agents rely on this, but you can use it too.
6. Use humour over rumour - if you can make your truth sandwich funny or entertaining, it will get more traction than a lecture or dry recital of facts.

The whole article is very good, with much more information about how to make these tactics work for you.
